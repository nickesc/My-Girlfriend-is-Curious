# My Girlfriend is Curious

My girlfriend wants to know what I'm listening to, and I don't like Spotify displaying it on their app, so I wrote a small server and HTML tag using [`Spotify's API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [`thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node`](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) that will return and display my current listening activity.

The goal with the frontend was to create an HTML tag that could be copied dropped into any project, as it was with scripting and styling inline. I wanted something that I could transplant to any webpage I wanted, including (as you can see in the [demo](https://nickesc.github.io/My-Girlfriend-is-Curious/)) Markdown without *too* much trouble. It struggles with images, especially the album cover width, and with some of the spacing, but works otherwise. This demo also, at the moment, only displays dummy data. The server it was housed on was shut down when Heroku removed their free tier, and I don't currently have an alternative so it isn't able to connect with the frontend.

The main thing to consider when dropping it into a site is that it'll make the bottom 100 pixels of your page invisible on mobile when it's expanded, so build with that in mind. And there can only be one of these at a time on your site, more will break any additional players. Honestly, I'm not sure where I'll use this, other than maybe my website, but it was a lot of fun to make.

The player is hidden by default, but on expanding it you can see it shows my currently playing track and its metadata (which all links back to Spotify), the current position in the song, player options like shuffle, and the playback device. If there is no song playing, it shows as "Offline." The player updates every five seconds, so it gives a near real-time view of what I'm listening to on Spotify.
