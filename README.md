# My Girlfriend is Curious
### â€”about what I listen to on Spotify!

My girlfriend wants to know what I'm listening to, and I don't like Spotify displaying it on their app, so I wrote a small server and HTML tag using [`Spotify's API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [`thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node`](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) that will return and display my current listening activity.

The goal with the frontend was to create an HTML tag that could be copied dropped into any project, as it was with scripting and styling inline. I wanted something that I could transplant to any webpage I wanted, including (as you can see in the [demo](https://nickesc.github.io/My-Girlfriend-is-Curious/), it can even be dropped into Markdown without *too* much trouble)

The player shows the currently playing track and its metadata, the current position in the song, player options like shuffle and repeat, the playback device and links back to Spotify. If there is no song playing, it shows as "Offline." The player updates every five seconds, so it gives a near real-time view of what I'm listening to on Spotify.
