My girlfriend wants to know what I'm listening to, so I wrote a small server and HTML tag using [`Spotify's API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [`thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node`](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) that will return and display my current listening activity.
